## Connected components, bridges, articulations points

##### Definitions (that may not be accurate)
- In a connected undirected graph, a **bridge** is an edge that if removed the graph becomes disconnected.
- In a connected undirected graph, an **articulation point** or a **cur vertex** is a node that if removed the graph
  becomes disconnected.
- A **strongly connected component** is a graph where every two nodes are reachable from each others.
